# Doglingo üéØ


## Basic Details
###  Name: Anagha Murali



### Project Description
Doglingo is a fun web app that ‚Äútranslates‚Äù dog barks into humorous messages. üê∂‚ú®

It listens to a dog's bark through the mic, analyzes the sound, and then shows a playful translation ‚Äî like "Feed me now!" or "That squirrel was personal." It also has animated waveforms and cute UI features to make it feel like you're actually chatting with your dog.


### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
"What is my dog really trying to say when it barks?"

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
helps understand our dogs deep problems
